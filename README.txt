READ ME:
1. For this to work youre going to have to install XAMPP and turn on the Apache and MYSQL.
2. Next youre going to want to import the "junkyard.sql" database to localhost/phpmyadmin in the browser.
3. Once you have your database imported onto the local host and you have the apache and MySQL turned on within XAMPP, go to your XAMPP folder
    on your system and insert the "login" folder that you downloaded into the "htdocs" folder within XAMPP. eg: C:\xampp\htdocs (mine looks like this). If you do not insert the login folder into this "htdocs" folder within XAMPP the localhost website wont work.
4. Once you have all of these done make your way to http://localhost/login/Login.html in your browser and the username is "admin" and password is "password".
5. Here you should be able to see your data at the bottom of the page and if you cant you might have uploaded it incorrectly on the localhost/phpmyadmin .
6. You can navigate throughout all existing databases and if you want to enter data for that specific database you can click on the "ENTER DATA" button at the top which will bring you to the source of the database where you can edit entries and enter more data if need be.
